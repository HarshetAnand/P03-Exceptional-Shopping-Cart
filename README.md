# P03 Exceptional Shopping Cart
In this assignment, I implemented an enhanced version of the Shopping Cart (P01).
The following features include:

• Throw exceptions to report bugs or misuse of a set of methods that have already
implemented in P01.

• Load cart summary to the exceptional shopping cart from a file.

• Save the cart summary of the cart in a file too, with respect to a specific format.

• Develop unit tests to check the correctness of the implementation of the different operations
supported by our exceptional shopping cart.
